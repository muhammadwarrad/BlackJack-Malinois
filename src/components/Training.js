            We offer a 2, 4, 6, or 8 week handlers course that is tailored to your agency's specific needs. Together our instructors have over 40 years combined working dog experience and 15 years of Law Enforcement K-9 experience.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
            Additionally, we host guest speakers who are subject matter experts in their respective fields throughout the course. A licensed Veterinarian covers the K-9 health and emergency care portion of our course and a practicing criminal attorney covers the K-9 law and legal update portion of our course.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
            Upon completion of our course, our teams are certified through a 3rd party NNDDA certifier. While unforeseen challenges can and do arise, we work with agencies to ensure every dog and handler is ready for certification, even if it means we extend the course a bit for those teams needing the extra time. <strong>All K-9 teams are guaranteed to certify upon completion of our course.</strong>
